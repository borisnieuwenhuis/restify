Trying to create a rest api automtically as a wsgi middleware, on the base of a gae model class

run make nose for test
include restify.py in your project and add for gae class member
RestifyMiddleware(get_application(), Member, 'member')

this is of course not safe, you are exposing your model classes as is for the whole world to abuse.
